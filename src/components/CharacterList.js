// REST: https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/
// GraphQL: https://rickandmortyapi.com/graphql/
// Api docs: https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation

// This is the list view, here we need to do several things:

// 1. Make a call to the api to get the first 10 charaters (check with a console.log())
// 2. Iterate over the charaters and display each one with its photo and some other attributes
// 3. Make each item a link in order to navigate to a character detail view.

export default CharacterList
