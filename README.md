This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
It can also be completed in codesandbox: https://codesandbox.io/s/eager-field-mxhfq

## Front end tech test

- Clone the repo and run `npm install` or `yarn`
- Run `npm start` or `yarn start`
- The app has a skeleton file system, you'll need to start writing a component in components/CharacterList.js
- We'll be pair programming with you so please feel free to ask questions and explain your thinking along the way.
- We've also put some code comments and links to relevant documentation in the components

## Objectives

- Fetch and display a list of characters from the given api using your react knowledge
- Bonus: Create a "Detail view" by making each list item a link to a page where you can see further details.
